# 5. Air Control ("Dubai Tower")
## 5.1 General provisions
Air Control (AIR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways. AIR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information to VFR aircraft operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## 5.2 Preferential runways
The preferred calm wind configuration is departing runway 30R, and landing 30L, which shall be used up to a 5-knot tailwind. When this is unfeasible due to winds or other circumstances, the configuration shall be departing 12R and landing 12L.

## 5.3 Departure procedures
### 5.3.1 Standard departure points
Dubai has “standard departure points” from which pilots are expected to base their performance calculations. Aircraft may be tactically issued holding points closer to the runway end to optimise traffic flow or to yield a more efficient departure sequence. If the standard departure point is insufficient, crews must advice ATC of the required departure on first contact. The AIR controller may issue delays for such departures based on runway dependency requirements, as priority is given to the standard departure points.

| Runway | Standard departure points |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|   30L  |          K15/M18A         |
|   30R  |          M13/N8A          |
|   12L  |          M1C/N1C          |
|   12R  |             K5            |

### 5.3.2 Line up clearances
Conditional line up instructions shall include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission. It is recommended to only have a maximum of two conditional line up clearances active at one i.e., one aircraft lining up behind a departure, and another aircraft lining up behind them.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "AFR662, behind the departing Emirates A380, via M13A, line up and wait runway 30R behind."

If aircraft have not yet reached the holding point where they are expected to line up at, ATC shall reiterate the cleared holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE4KC, via M14A, line up and wait runway 30R."

### 5.3.3 Take-off clearances
Aircraft shall be cleared for take-off once adequate separation exists as provided in 4.3.4 and 4.6. 

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE4KC, wind 330 degrees 7 knots, runway 30R, cleared for take-off."

### 5.3.4 Separation requirements
#### 5.3.4.1 General
Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure separation minima, enhanced wake turbulence separation (eWTS) requirements or as provided in 4.6 where applicable.

Except as provided in 4.3.4.2, succeeding aircraft on the same SID shall be separated by a minimum of **2 minutes**.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence separation minima exists.

#### 5.3.4.2 Muscat FIR flow control procedure
Special flow control procedures are required for traffic entering the Muscat FIR via certain entry points after departure from UAE airports. 

During off-peak times, this separation minima may be disregarded, and standard separation minima of **2 minutes** may be applied provided it is not done for more than two successive departures.

|  SID  | FIR exit point | Longitudinal separation |
|:-----:|:--------------:|-------------------------|
| ANVIX |      TARDI     | 3 minutes               |
| IVURO |   LALDO/GOMTA  | 3 minutes               |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 5-2: Flow control procedures for traffic entering the Muscat FIR</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note
    LALDO and GOMTA are to be considered a common FIR exit point. These procedures do not apply to traffic landing at Oman airports.

#### 5.3.4.3 Low visibility and IMC
During low visibility operations and during IMC, departing aircraft shall not be cleared for take-off when there is an arriving aircraft within **4 NM** of the landing runway threshold.

### 5.3.5 IFR handoff procedure
#### 5.3.5.1 General
IFR departures shall be handed off to the appropriate departure controller as provided in 4.3.5.2 and 4.3.5.3.

Except as provided in 4.4.3, aircraft shall be handed off when passing 800 ft to ensure adequate time for a frequency change and avoid a level-off on departure.

Where DEP 2 is offline, all handoffs shall be to DEP 1. If DEP 1 is offline, handoffs shall be made to APP.

Where no approach controller is present, aircraft shall be handed off directly to the appropriate UAE controller.

#### 5.3.5.2 Procedure for 30 configuration
IFR aircraft shall be handed off in the following manner:

</figure>

### 5.3.6 Omnidirectional departures
Aircraft departing on an omnidirectional departure shall be instructed to fly a specific heading on departure appropriate to the Dubai CTA exit point. This departure instruction shall be delivered to the aircraft before issuing the take-off clearance

When departing 30L/R, they may be assigned a heading from 270 clockwise to 350. When departing 12L/R, they may be assigned 090 clockwise to 160.

These headings shall be coordinated with departures control.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "AEE959, after departure, turn left heading 270 degrees and maintain 4000ft, wind 280 degrees, 6 knots, runway 30R, cleared for take-off."

### 5.3.7 Stopping a departure
Aircraft that have commenced their take-off roll may be instructed to stop immediately to avert a collision due to a runway incursion or any other dangerous situation. 

It must be noted though, that the instruction to stop must be given early enough such that the aircraft does not reach its decision speed. Therefore, aerodrome controllers must be vigilant and remain aware of the location of traffic at all times as well as runway incursion hotspots.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE1KM, stop immediately, I say again stop immediately, truck entering the runway!"

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FDB687, hold position, cancel take-off, I say again cancel take-off, aircraft entering the runway, acknowledge."

## 5.4 Arrival Procedures
### 5.4.1 Preferred exit points
On initial contact, aircraft shall be instructed to vacate at a designated taxiway for arrival. The planned exit point shall be one of the preferred exit taxiways (Table 5-2).

| Landing Runway | Preferred Exit POint |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
|       30L      |          K8          |
|       30R      |        M6, N5        |
|       12L      |          M9          |
|       12R      |          K13         |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 5-5: Preferred exit points</figcaption>
</figure>

### 5.4.2 Separation requirements
#### 5.4.2.1 General
While the radar controllers are responsible for separating arriving aircraft, the AIR controller shall still ensure that minimum separation is maintained until the preceding aircraft crosses the runway threshold. 

#### 5.4.2.2 Speed control
If it is apparent that minimum separation may not exist as provided in 4.4.2.1, AIR may use a tactical reduction in aircraft speed.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FDB1784, reduce to final approach speed."

#### 5.4.2.3 Visual separation
Aircraft may be instructed to maintain own separation visually, if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

### 5.4.3 Go-around instruction
#### 5.4.3.1 General go-around procedure
At any time should a runway become unsuitable for an aircraft landing, or separation minima is not met, aircraft shall be instructed to go-around.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE797, go around, I say again, go around, acknowledge."

Once aircraft have acknowledged the instruction and are observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to departure control.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE797, climb to 3000ft via standard missed approach, contact Dubai Departures 121.025."

#### 5.4.3.2 Go-around with simultaneous departure in VMC
In the event of a go-around with a simultaneous departure in VMC conditions, the AIR controller shall take the following action: 

- If the go-around traffic is within **4 NM** of the landing threshold and there is a simultaneous departure, the go-around traffic shall be instructed to **climb to 4000 ft** and maintain a heading of **270 degrees for 30L**, a heading of **330 degrees for 30R** or a heading or **090 degrees for 12L**.
If the departure is expected to turn into the arriving traffic, the aircraft shall be instructed to **maintain runway heading** and/or be instructed to **stop climb at 3000 feet** as appropriate.
- If there are no simultaneous departures or if the go-around traffic is further than **4 NM** of the landing threshold, the go-around traffic shall be instructed to follow the standard missed approach.

In all cases, instructions for avoiding action shall be issued if there is a risk that the go-around aircraft will overtake the departing aircraft.

Departures shall not be permitted to commence their take-off roll until the go-around traffic has passed the upwind threshold of the departure runway.

Departure handoffs to Dubai Departures may be delayed to ensure compliance with the requirements as provided above.

#### 5.4.3.2 Go-around with simultaneous departure in IMC or during LVO
Aircraft shall be instructed to follow the standard missed approach and aircraft shall not be permitted to depart if an arriving aircraft is within **4 NM** of the landing threshold.

### 5.4.4 Arrival taxi procedures
In accordance with the taxi procedures laid down in 3.4, aircraft shall be provided an initial taxi clearance to ensure they are kept moving such that the rapid exit taxiway (RET) is clear for the next arrival.

The initial taxi shall include instructions to taxi “LEFT” or “RIGHT” onto the relevant taxiway as appropriate and hold at a suitable intermediate holding point.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE572M taxi left via J2, hold J2A."

Once aircraft have been observed to be taxiing and completely clear of the RET, transfer of control shall be initiated to GMC provided there will be no conflicts with other arriving traffic.

In accordance with the procedures laid down in 4.9, where the AIR controller’s designated zone of responsibility extends beyond the RET, aircraft shall not be transferred until they are completely clear of the designated zone of responsibility unless it has been assured that all traffic will remain clear of RETs.

## 5.5 Reduced runway separation minima (RRSM)
### 5.5.1 Conditions for the application of RRSM
Reduced runway separation may be applied at any time during day or night between:

- A departing aircraft and a succeeding aircraft using a single runway; or
- Two successive landing aircraft; or
- Two successive departing aircraft.

The following conditions must apply:

- The tailwind component does not exceed 5 knots at the landing threshold and there are no pilots reports of wind shear;
- Meteorological visibility is equal to or greater than 5000 metres and cloud ceiling is not less than 1000 ft. The AIR controller should be satisfied that the following aircraft will be able to observe the relevant traffic completely and continuously;
- Traffic information is provided to the crew of the succeeding aircraft;
- The runway is dry and there is no evidence that braking action will be adversely affected;
- The AIR controller is able to assess separation visually or by radar-derived information; 
- Suitable landmarks and markers on the surface surveillance system shall be available to assist the controller in assessing separation between aircraft;
- Wake turbulence separation minima shall be applied;
- Minimum separation continues to exist between two departing aircraft immediately after departure of the second aircraft;
- The pilot of an arriving aircraft is advised of the exit point where they are expected to vacate.

### 5.5.2 Single runway mode procedure
#### 5.5.2.1 Landing following landing
When the runway‐in‐use is temporarily occupied by other traffic, landing clearance may be issued to an arriving aircraft, provided that the controller has reasonable assurance that the following separation criteria will be met when the landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold of:

- **Runway 12L/30R**:
    - The preceding landing aircraft has landed and has vacated the runway; or has passed a point at least 2500 metres from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway N7 and taxiway M10A for runway 12L, abeam the runway exit points for taxiway N3A and taxiway M3A for runway 30R); and is in motion and will vacate the runway without stopping and/or backtracking. Landing RRSM shall only be applied between two successive arrivals provided both aircraft have been instructed to vacate at published rapid exit taxiways (RETs).

- **Runway 12R/30L**:
    - The preceding landing aircraft has landed and has vacated the runway; or has passed a point at least 2500 metres from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway M17 and taxiway K14 for runway 12R; abeam the runway exit points for taxiway M11 and taxiway K8 for runway 30L); and is in motion and will vacate the runway without stopping and/or backtracking.

- **All Runways**:
    - The preceding arriving aircraft must have touched down and roll out with a good deceleration schedule towards the assigned vacate point while the arriving aircraft is no closer than 60 seconds from touchdown. Landing RRSM shall only be applied between two successive arrivals provided both aircraft have been instructed to vacate at published rapid exit taxiways (RETs).

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE96, 777 vacating at K6, [surface] wind 260 degrees 5 knots, runway 30L, cleared to land."

#### 5.5.2.2 Landing following departure
When the runway‐in‐use is temporarily occupied by other traffic, landing clearance may be issued to an arriving aircraft, provided that the controller has reasonable assurance that the following separation distances/criteria will be met when the landing aircraft crosses the runway threshold:

- **Runway 12L/30R**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and has passed a point at least 2500 M from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway N7 and taxiway M10A for runway 12L, abeam the runway exit points for taxiway N3A and taxiway M3A for runway 30R), or if not airborne, will be at least 2500 M from the threshold of the runway.

- **Runway 12R/30L**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft will be airborne and has passed a point at least 2500m from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway M17 and taxiway K14 for runway 12R; abeam the runway exit points for taxiway M11 and taxiway K8 for runway 30L), or if not airborne, will be at least 2500 M from the threshold of the runway.

- **Runway 30L/R**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft must have commenced their take-off roll while the arriving aircraft is no closer than **2.0NM** from touchdown.

- **Runway 12L/R**:
    - The preceding departing aircraft must have commenced their take-off roll while the arriving aircraft is no closer than **2.5NM** from touchdown.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FDB754, 777 departing ahead, [surface] wind 330 degrees 15 knots, runway 30R, cleared to land."

#### 5.5.2.3 Departure following departure
Take‐off clearance may be issued to a departing aircraft, commencing its take‐off roll from full length, before the preceding departure has passed the upwind end of the runway; provided:

- **Runway 12L/30R**:
    - The preceding aircraft is airborne, and has passed a point at least 2500 M from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway N7 and taxiway M10A for runway 12L, abeam the runway exit points for taxiway N3A and taxiway M3A for runway 30R) and minimum separation continues to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after take‐off of the second aircraft.

- **Runway 12R/30L**:
    - The preceding aircraft is airborne, and has passed a point at least 2500 M from the threshold of the runway (abeam taxiway M17 and taxiway K14 for runway 12R; abeam the runway exit points for taxiway M11 and taxiway K8 for runway 30L) and minimum separation continues to exist, constant or increasing, between the two departing aircraft immediately after take-off of the second aircraft.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "BOX514, 737 departing ahead, [surface] wind 120 degrees 7 knots, runway 12R, cleared for take-off."

### 5.5.3 Dual dependent runway mode
The procedures described for single runway operations in 4.6.2.1, and 4.6.2.3 shall be applied in the same manner on respective runways during dual runway operations.

The exception for dual runway operations is when the runway mode becomes dependent in VMC (i.e. when aircraft are departing full length 12R from K1, K2, M4, M5B; or full length 30R from M15, M15A, N11, N12). 

The difference from single runway operations, is in the scenario "landing following departure": 

- In the **runway 12** direction, a preceding departing aircraft off runway 12R must have passed abeam taxiway M10B and taxiway K7, prior to the landing aircraft crossing the threshold of runway 12L. 
- In the **runway 30** direction, a preceding departing aircraft off runway 30R must have passed abeam taxiway M10A and taxiway N7, prior to the landing aircraft crossing the threshold of runway 30L.

## 5.6 VFR procedures
### 5.6.1 VFR departures
Once VFR aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report leaving the control zone.

Once aircraft are clear of the zone, they shall be instructed to remain outside controlled airspace and monitor advisory frequency.

Aircraft climbing into controlled airspace shall be handed off to departure control.


### 5.6.2 VFR traffic remaining in the circuit
AIR control is responsible for managing circuit traffic. Circuits must always be conducted to the south of the aerodrome. 

Circuits shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures laid down in 2.8.3.

Once aircraft are ready for departure, they shall be cleared for take-off in sequence. As they begin their crosswind turn (the first turn after departure) they shall be instructed to report when they are on the downwind with their intentions.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ATA, report downwind with intentions."

Aircraft may request either a touch and go (where the aircraft lands and immediately takes off), a stop and go (where the aircraft lands, comes to a complete stop on the runway, then takes off), a low approach (where the aircraft flies low over the runway without landing), or a full stop (where the aircraft lands and vacates the runway).

Once AIR is aware of the aircraft’s request, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind shall be passed the following information:

- Expected runway;
- Sequence;
- Traffic information, if applicable

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ATA, report final runway 30R, number 1."

    **Controller**: "ATA, runway 30R, cleared to land/touch and go/low approach."

Aircraft conducting a stop-and go shall be required to “REPORT READY FOR DEPARTURE”.

### 5.6.3 VFR arrivals
Inbound VFR aircraft shall be instructed to contact AIR with enough time such that two-way radio communications has been established before aircraft enter the aerodrome control zone. 

On first contact, AIR will pass circuit joining instructions, as well as any other pertinent information.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-LDW, Dubai Tower, join left hand downwind runway 30L, 1000ft VFR, QNH 1017."

Aircraft may also be instructed to track towards a visual reporting point (VRP).

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-LDW, Dubai Tower, track towards water tank, 1000ft VFR. Report one mile from water tank, QNH 1007."

VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone during times of increased IFR arrival activity and instructed to hold outside controller airspace awaiting further instructions.

## 5.7 Low visibility operations (LVO)
### 5.7.1 Commencement of LVO
Low visibility operations (LVO) are commenced at Dubai when:

- Touchdown RVR is indicated to be 600 metres or less;
- Reported meteorological visibility is 600 metres or less;
- The reported cloud ceiling is less than 300 feet

LVO may be pre-emptively initiated when RVR or meteorological visibility is reported at or below 1500 m and forecast to reduce below LVO minima, or the cloud ceiling is reported as 500 ft, and forecast to reduce below LVO minima. 

Runway crossings shall be kept to a minimum and must only occur at designated LVO runway crossing points.

### 5.7.2 LVO departure procedures
During LVO, aircraft must use CAT II/III holding points for all runways in order to protect ILS-critical areas. 

CAT II/III holding points must be used during LVO for departing aircraft (Table 5-4).

| Runway | Holding Point |
|:------:|:-------------:|
|   30R  |    N10/M14A   |
|   12R  |     M4/K1     |
|   12L  |    N1A/M1A    |
|   30L  |    K17/M20    |
<figure markdown>
  <figcaption>Table 5-9: CATII/III holding points</figcaption>
</figure>

### 5.7.3 LVO arrival procedures
Arriving aircraft must not to vacate onto M in both directions and must report fully vacated. 

## 5.8 Designated areas of responsibility
### 5.8.1 AIR positions
Dubai has two AIR positions, AIR 1 and AIR 2. 

AIR 1 controls runway 30R/12L as well as all associated exit taxiways and runway holding points. AIR 2 controls runway 30L/12R as well as all associated exit taxiways and runway holding points. 

The airspace directly around the airport is split along taxiway M. all airspace north of M is delegated to AIR1, while the southern half is delegated to AIR 2. 

(See 6.2 and 6.3)

### 5.8.2 Handoff procedure
Where transfer of control is to be made between aerodrome controllers, aircraft shall not be cleared to a point beyond the current controller’s designated zone of responsibility unless there has been prior coordination with the next controller. Intermediate holding points may be used to satisfy this requirement.
For runway crossings, the crossing instruction must only be issued by the designated AIR controller for the respective runway unless prior coordination has been conducted.

### 5.8.3 Splitting procedure
Where there is only one controller, they shall cover all runways and associated airspace from the AIR 1 position. 

Unless otherwise authorised by the Arabian vACC staff, GMP (Dubai Delivery) and at least one GMC (Dubai Ground) position must be online before two AIR (Dubai Tower) positions may be opened.
