# 3. Position Specific Phraseology
## 3.1 Clearance delivery
### 3.1.1 Clearances and read back requirements
Controllers should issue clearances with consideration that pilots may need time to write them down.  

#### 3.1.1.1 Timing of Clearances  
- Aircraft clearances should be delivered **prior to start-up**.  
- Controllers should avoid issuing clearances during periods of **high cockpit workload**, such as when an aircraft is:  
  - Lining up on the runway  
  - Taking off  

#### 3.1.1.2 ATC Route Clearance  
- An ATC route clearance **is not** an instruction to take off or enter an active runway.  
- The word **“TAKE-OFF”** must only be used:  
  - When an aircraft is cleared for take-off  
  - When cancelling a take-off clearance  
- At all other times, use the words **“DEPARTURE”** or **“AIRBORNE”** instead.  

#### 3.1.1.3 Pilot Readback Requirements  
Pilots are required to provide a **full readback** (including their callsign) for the following ATC clearances, instructions, or information:  
- ATC route, taxi, approach, and departure clearances, including amendments  
- Clearances to VFR aircraft to operate within controlled airspace or enter/vacate the circuit  
- Instructions to enter, land on, take off from, hold short of, cross, or backtrack on any runway  
- Runway in use, altimeter settings, SSR codes, level instructions, heading and speed instructions, transition levels, and frequency change instructions (whether issued by ATC or broadcast via ATIS)  
- Instructions to push back and taxi on the movement area  
- Conditional clearances  

#### 3.1.1.4 Clearance Delivery Content  
Clearances issued by clearance delivery controllers should include:  
1. **Aircraft callsign**  
2. **Confirmation of destination**  
3. **Assigned departure** (e.g., RNAV SID, RNAV RADAR DEPARTURE, or omnidirectional instructions)  
4. **Assigned runway**  
5. **Initial altitude**  
6. **Assigned squawk code**  

### 3.1.2 Squawk code assignment
Controllers must actively listen to, and insist upon, a correct **readback** to ensure that the clearance or instruction has been properly acknowledged. If any discrepancies are identified in the readback or if a readback is missing, controllers shall take **immediate action** to correct the error. 

#### 3.1.2.1 General (Single Runway)
!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 0534."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN 4000FT, SQUAWK 0534, EMIRATES 587"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, WILCO, EMIRATES 587."

#### 3.1.2.2 General (Dual Runway)
!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 587, CLEARED TO TASHKENT VIA TULON1P, RUNWAY 31R, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 0534."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO TASHKENT VIA TULON1P, RUNWAY31R, MAINTAIN 4000FT, SQUAWK 0534, ETIHAD 587"

    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, WILCO, ETIHAD 587."

#### 3.1.2.3 Dubai Specific
!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 0534."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO AMSTERDAM VIA SENPA2F, MAINTAIN 4000FT, SQUAWK 0534, EMIRATES 587"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1018, WILCO, EMIRATES 587."

#### 3.1.2.4 Doha Specific
!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 35B, CLEARED TO MUNICH, TULUB1W DEPARTURE, CLIMB VIA THE SID TO ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 2615."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO MUNICH, TULUB1W DEPARTURE, CLIMB VIA THE SID TO ALTITUDE 4000 FEET, SQUAWK 2615, QATARI 35B"

    **Controller**: "QATARI 35B, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION X-RAY, QNH 1013, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: "INFORMATION X-RAY, QNH 1015, WILCO, QATARI 35B."

At Doha, the **runway is not specified** in the clearance because the **SIDs are runway-dependent**. The Qatar AIP explicitly states that pilots should **avoid asking for the runway** on frequency.  

### 3.1.3 Correct readback
If the aircraft's readback is correct, the clearance delivery controller should respond with the phrase **“READBACK CORRECT”**. The controller should then provide details of the **active ATIS letter** along with the **local QNH**.

### 3.1.4 Incorrect readback
If an aircraft's readback is incorrect, the controller shall transmit **“NEGATIVE, I SAY AGAIN”**, followed by the correct version of the clearance or instruction.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, SQUAWK 0535."

    **Pilot**: "SQUAWK 587, EMIRATES 587"

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, NEGATIVE I SAY AGAIN SQUAWK 0535."

    **Pilot**: "SQUAWK 0535, EMIRATES 587."

### 3.1.5 Aircraft unable an instruction
If there is any doubt as to whether a pilot can comply with an ATC clearance or instruction, the controller may follow the clearance or instruction with the phrase **“IF UNABLE”**, and then provide an alternative.  

If at any time a pilot receives a clearance or instruction that cannot be complied with, the pilot shall inform the controller by using the phrase **“UNABLE”** and provide the reasons for the inability to comply. 

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "UNABLE SID, DUE AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT, REQUEST OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, IFLY 387"

    **Controller**: "IFLY 587, ROGER, EXPECT OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE."

### 3.1.6 Reclearance
When an ATC route clearance is changed for ATC reasons or in response to an aircraft's request, the new instructions will be issued in the form of a **reclearance**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, RECLEARED VIA TULUB1W, REST OF CLEARANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED."

    **Pilot**: "ROGER TULUB1W, REST OF CLEARANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED, QATARI 587"

    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 587, NEW CRUSING LEVEL FL340."

    **Pilot**: "ROGER NEW CRUISING LEVEL FL340, ETIHAD 587."

### 3.1.7 Omnidirectional or radar departures
Some aircraft may be unable to fly an RNAV SID, or may not have the latest RNAV SIDs installed. In such cases, controllers shall issue an **omnidirectional departure**. This includes:  

- The **departure runway**  
- A **heading** to fly after departure (normally runway heading)  
- The **altitude** to climb to after departure  
- Assigned **squawk code**  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, CLEARED TO BANGALORE VIA OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB TO ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK 0543."

    **Pilot**: "CLEAERED TO BANGALORE VIA OMNIDIRECTIONAL DEPARTURE, MAINTAIN RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB TO ALTITUDE 4000FT, SQUAWK 0543, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [READBACK] CORRECT, INFORMATION F, QNH1015, REPORT READY FOR PUSH AND START."

    **Pilot**: “INFORMATION A, QNH1015, WILCO, EMIRATES 587.”

## 3.2 Ground movement control
### 3.2.1 Pushback clearance
At most aerodromes, including those in the Arabian FIRs, aircraft are parked with the nose facing the terminal and require a **pushback** before taxiing for departure. Requests for pushback are made using **local aerodrome-specific ground movement procedures**.  

At certain aerodromes, the **taxiway** to push onto may be specified.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "MUSCAT GROUND, OMAN AIR 587, STAND 303, REQUEST PUSH AND START."

    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 587, STAND 303, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE TO THE EAST."

    **Pilot**: "STAND 303, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE TO THE EAST, OMAN AIR 587."

### 3.2.2 Taxi clearance
#### 3.2.2.1 Taxi and Clearance Procedures  
The pilot of the aircraft is required to state their **location** when requesting to start engines, pushback, or taxi clearance.  

When an aircraft wishes to depart from a runway other than the one nominated as in use:  
- **IFR flights** must make this request **prior to engine start**.  
- **VFR aircraft** must include this request in their **taxi clearance request**.  

If an aircraft requires a **reduced length for take-off** or needs to **backtrack** from a runway entry point, this request must be included in the taxi clearance, along with any other intentions significant to ATC.  

#### 3.2.2.2 Taxi Instructions and Clearance Limits  

Taxi instructions issued by a controller will always include a **clearance limit**, which is the point at which the aircraft must stop unless further permission is granted. The clearance limit may not necessarily be a position from which the aircraft can enter the runway or apron, but could be any other position on the aerodrome, depending on the situation. Taxi instructions may also specify a **taxi route**.  

When a taxi clearance includes a limit beyond a runway, it must contain either:  
- An explicit **clearance to cross** the runway  
- An instruction to **hold short** of that runway  

#### 3.2.2.3 Runway Vacated  

**Note**: When a clearance includes the instruction **“report runway vacated”**, the runway is considered vacated when the entire aircraft has passed the relevant **runway holding position**.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "HAMAD GROUND, QATARI 587, REQUEST TAXI."

    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, TAXI VIA E, C, A2, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 34R."

    **Pilot**: "TAXI VIA E, C, A2, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 34R, QATARI 587."

### 3.2.3 Conditional clearance
In certain situations, it may be beneficial for controllers to issue a **conditional clearance** to an aircraft, for example: “**BEHIND PASSING EGYPTAIR BOEING 777 FROM LEFT TO RIGHT**.”  

A **conditional clearance** should always include:  

- **Aircraft callsign**  
- The **condition** of the request  
- The **clearance**  
- A brief **reiteration of the condition**  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "FEDEX 12, BEHIND THE EMIRATES BOEING 777, PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, STAND E14, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE EAST, BEHIND."

    **Pilot**: "BEHIND THE EMIRATES BOEING 777, PASSING LEFT TO RIGHT, STAND E14, PUSH AND START APPROVED, FACE EAST, FEDEX12."

A **conditional clearance** may also be used by other **ATS positions**, such as **TWR** (Tower).  

## 3.3 Aerodrome Control
### 3.3.1 General
In the **Arabian FIRs**, some aerodromes may have separate **ground** and **tower** frequencies. Controllers should be mindful of their designated **areas of responsibility** and perform **handoffs** accordingly.  

Care should be taken to ensure that the **phraseology** used during the **taxi manoeuvre** cannot be interpreted as a clearance to **enter** or **take off** from the runway.  

### 3.3.2 Take-off clearance
A **take-off clearance** must be issued separately from any other clearance.  

When multiple runways are in use and there is potential for confusion regarding the runway to be used, the **runway designator** shall be included in the take-off clearance.  

**Surface wind** information shall be provided if there is a significant difference from the previously passed wind conditions.  

A **take-off clearance** should only include the **runway holding point** if the aircraft is **not already situated** at that holding point.  

#### 3.3.2.1 General
!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, FROM M13A [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "FROM M13A, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, EMIRATES 587."

**Note**: *The pilot should not read back the surface winds, nor should the controller expect a readback of this.*  

Except in cases of emergency, controllers should **not transmit** to an aircraft during the process of take-off or during the early stages of climb.  

For traffic reasons, it may be necessary for the aircraft to **take off immediately after lining up**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, ARE YOU READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE?"

    **Pilot**: "AFFIRM, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED IMMEDIATE TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "RUNWAY 30R, CLEARED IMMEDIATE TAKE-OFF, EMIRATES 587."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 587, LINE UP RUNWAY 30R, BE READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE"

    **Pilot**: "LINE UP RUNWAY 30R, WE ARE READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE, EMIRATES 587."

During **low visibility operations**, the controller may request the pilot to **report when airborne**.  

#### 3.3.2.2 Doha Specific
The **departure frequency** is issued as part of the **take-off clearance**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, FROM A2 [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, FROM A2, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, QATARI 587."

    **Controller**: "QATARI 587, AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, [SURFACE] WIND, 300 DEGREES, 18 KNOTS, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF."

    **Pilot**: "AIRBORNE CONTACT DOHA RADAR ON 121.1, RUNWAY 34R, CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF, QATARI 587."

### 3.3.3 Cancelling take-off clearance
Due to unexpected traffic developments or a departing aircraft taking longer to take off than anticipated, it may be necessary to **cancel the take-off clearance** or quickly **clear the runway** for landing traffic. In such situations, the pilot must **acknowledge the instruction** with their **callsign** and **intentions**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SPEEDBIRD 106, TAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY OR HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY"

    **Pilot**: "HOLDING SHORT, SPEEDBIRD 106"

    **Controller**: "SPEEDBIRD 106, TAKE-OFF IMMEDIATELY OR VACATE RUNWAY"

    **Pilot**: "TAKING OFF, SPEEDBIRD 106."

    **Controller**: "PQR, HOLD POSITION, CANCEL TAKE-OFF CLEARANCE, I SAY AGAIN CANCEL TAKE-OFF DUE <Reason> ACKNOWLEDGE."

    **Pilot**: "HOLDING/STOPPING, PQR."

When a pilot abandons the take-off maneuver, the **control tower** should be informed as soon as practicable. The pilot should also request **assistance** or **taxi instructions** as needed.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "KLM 428, STOPPING."

    **Controller**: “KLM428, ROGER” OR “KLM428, ROGER, DO YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE.”

    **Pilot**: "REQUEST RETURN TO STAND, KLM428."

    **Controller**: "KLM428, ROGER, TAXI FIRST LEFT, CONTACT GROUND 118.350."

    **Pilot**: "FIRST LEFT AND CONTACT GROUND 118.350, KLM428."

### 3.3.4 RRSM traffic information
When **reduced runway separation minima** are being applied, controllers shall provide **traffic information** about the preceding aircraft.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "KLM428, TRAFFIC IS AN EMIRATES BOEING 777 VACATING RUNWAY 30L AHEAD, SURFACE WIND 300 DEGREES 12 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L, CLEARED TO LAND."

    **Pilot**: “COPY TRAFFIC, RUNWAY 30L, CLEARED TO LAND, KLM428.”

### 3.3.5 VFR departures
**Departure clearances** may include a **CTR (control zone) sector**, a **VFR departure procedure**, or plain language instructions.  

Aircraft must, upon leaving the aerodrome traffic circuit, enter and remain within the lateral limits of any sector specified in the clearance, or follow the assigned route in the **VFR Departure Procedure** or the clearance.  

**Altitude instructions** are included in published **VFR Departure Procedures**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-BAC, LEAVE THE DUBAI CONTROL ZONE VIA VR6, AT 1000FT VFR, SQUAWK XXXX."

    **Pilot**: “LEAVE THE DUBAI CONTROL ZONE VIA VR6, AT 1000FT VFR, SQUAWK XXXX, A6-BAC”

### 3.3.6 VFR Circuits
Occasionally, aircraft may wish to **join** and remain in the circuit. Aircraft may perform **multiple approaches** and landings, commonly referred to as a **“touch and go”**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, AFTER DEPARTURE RUNWAY 30L, ENTER LEFT HAND CIRCUIT AT ALTITUDE 1000FT VFR, SQUAWK 6015."

    **Pilot**: “AFTER DEPARTURE RUNWAY 30L ENTER LEFT HAND CIRCUIT AT ALTITUDE 1000FT, SQUAWK 6015, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, EXTEND DOWNWIND NUMBER TWO, FOLLOW CHEROKEE FOUR MILES FINAL."

    **Pilot**: “EXTENDING DOWNWIND NUMBER TWO, TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, ORBIT RIGHT REPORT COMPLETE."

    **Pilot**: “ORBITING RIGHT, WILCO, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER ONE MAKE SHORT APPROACH CHEROKEE SIX MILES FINAL."

    **Pilot**: “SHORT APPROACH TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.7 VFR arrivals
The initial call to **aerodrome control** requesting clearance to enter a **CTR (control zone)** must be made in sufficient time to allow the controller to assess both **VFR** and **IFR traffic** situations and issue a clearance before the aircraft reaches the **CTR boundary**. Pilots must be advised if they are to operate in **special VFR conditions (SVFR)**.  

**Arrival clearances** may include a **CTR sector**, a **VFR Arrival Procedure**, plain language instructions, or **circuit joining instructions**. Aircraft must remain within the lateral limits of any sector in the clearance, follow the assigned route in the **VFR Arrival Procedure** or the clearance, and comply with **circuit joining** and **reporting instructions**. **Altitude instructions** are also included in the **VFR arrival clearance**.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, A6-EFR, GOOD DAY."

    **Controller**: "A6-EFR, DUBAI TOWER [PASS YOUR MESSAGE OR STAND BY]."

    **Pilot**: “AFR, COUNTRY CLUB 1500 FEET, INFORMATION TANGO, QNH 1018, FOR LANDING, POB THREE."

    **Controller**: "AFR, ENTER CONTROL ZONE VIA VL1, 1500 FEET OR BELOW, HOLD AT GARHOUD BRIDGE."

    **Pilot**: “ENTER CONTROL ZONE VIA VL1, 1500 FEET OR BELOW, HOLD AT GARHOUD AFR."

Requests for **circuit joining instructions** should be issued early enough to allow for a planned entry into the circuit, taking other traffic into account.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, A6-CYI, CESSNA 182 10 MILES SOUTH 1500FT FOR LANDING."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, DUBAI TOWER [ENTER CONTROL ZONE VIA…], JOIN RIGHT HAND DOWNWIND RUNWAY 30L, TRAFFIC IS A BOEING 737 ON DOWNWIND, REPORT IN SIGHT."

    **Pilot**: “RIGHT HAND RUNWAY 30L, BOEING 737 IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER TWO FOLLOW THE BOEING 737, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE."

    **Pilot**: “NUMBER TWO FOLLOWING BOEING 737, CAUTION COPIED, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.8 Circuit reporting points
The pilot, after joining the traffic circuit, must make **routine reports** as required by the **Arabian FIRs procedures**.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DOWNWIND RUNWAY 30L, FOR TOUCH AND GO, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, TRAFFIC IS BOEING 777 6 MILE FINAL, REPORT IN SIGHT."

    **Pilot**: “TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER TWO BEHIND THAT TRAFFIC, REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE."

    **Pilot**: “NUMBER TWO REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION COPIED, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.9 Coordinating circuit traffic
!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, EXTEND DOWNWIND, NUMBER TWO FOLLOWING CESSNA 172 ON FOUR MILES FINAL."

    **Pilot**: “EXTENDING DOWNWIND, NUMBER TWO TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, TRAFFIC IS A BOEING 777 6 MILE FINAL, REPORT IN SIGHT."

    **Pilot**: “TRAFFIC IN SIGHT, A6-CYI."

    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, NUMBER TWO BEHIND THAT TRAFFIC, REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE."

    **Pilot**: “NUMBER TWO REPORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L, CAUTION COPIED, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.10 Final approach and landing
#### 3.3.10.1 General
!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 381, 7 MILES FINAL, RUNWAY 30L."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 30L, NUMBER ONE."

    **Pilot**: “RUNWAY 30L, CONTINUE APPROACH NUMBER ONE, EMIRATES 381."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, WIND 270 DEGREES 13 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L CLEARED TO LAND."

    **Pilot**: “CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 381."

**Note**: *The pilot should not read back the surface winds, nor should the controller expect a readback of this.*  

#### 3.3.10.2 RRSM specific
!!! example
    **Pilot**: “DUBAI TOWER, EMIRATES 381, 7 MILES FINAL, RUNWAY 30L."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, PLAN TO VACATE K8, CONTINUE APPROACH RUNWAY 30L, NUMBER ONE."

    **Pilot**: “VACATE K8 RUNWAY 30L, CONTINUE APPROACH NUMBER ONE, EMIRATES 381."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, WIND 270 DEGREES 13 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L CLEARED TO LAND."

    **Pilot**: “CLEARED TO LAND, RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 381."

**Note**: *The pilot should not read back the surface winds, nor should the controller expect a readback of this.*  

If **RRSM procedures** are being utilized, **traffic information** should be incorporated into the **landing clearance**.  

### 3.3.11 Touch and go
If an aircraft wishes to perform a **touch and go**, the **vacate point** should be omitted from the clearance, and **“CLEARED TO LAND”** should be replaced with **“CLEARED TOUCH AND GO”**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, WIND 270 DEGREES 13 KNOTS, RUNWAY 30L, CLEARED TOUCH AND GO."

    **Pilot**: “CLEARED TOUCH AND GO RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 381."

### 3.3.12 Cancelling landing clearance
Where ATC wishes to **cancel a landing clearance** in situations where it will be re-issued in good time for the aircraft to make a safe landing, and to avoid the pilot initiating a **missed approach** before the transmission is complete, the following **phraseology** applies:  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CONTINUE APPROACH CANCEL LANDING CLEARANCE [REASON] ACKNOWLEDGE."

    **Pilot**: “LANDING CLEARANCE CANCELLED, CONTINUING APPROACH, EMIRATES 381."

When time permits, a **reason** for **cancelling the landing clearance** should be provided.  

### 3.3.13 Wind shear
Upon receiving an **air-report** of **wind shear** or other **weather hazards**, the controller should:  

- **Immediately relay** the report to other aircraft concerned by hazardous weather phenomena  
- **Pass the full report** to the associated **MET unit**  
- **Pass the information** to other **ATSUs** that may be affected by hazardous weather phenomena  

**Note**: *A warning may be broadcast on the **ATIS** (where possible).*  

Wind shear reports should be relayed using the following standard sequence, with the contents depending on the details of the original report:  

- **Wind shear** — identifier  
- **Aircraft type** — added if not included in the original report  
- **Description of event** — no change to the report as received from the pilot (see also below)  
- **Height wind shear encountered** — no change to the report as received from the pilot  
- **Phase of flight** — no change to the report as received from the pilot  
- **Runway** — added if not included in the original report  
- **Time of encounter** — no change to the report as received from the pilot  
- **MET/operational information** (e.g., speed loss or speed gain) — no change to the report as received from the pilot  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CAUTION WIND SHEAR. AT 0937 BOEING 747 REPORTED STRONG WIND AT 300 FT ON APPROACH RWY 27. MAX THRUST WAS REQUIRED."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, EMIRATES 381."

ATSU should continue to transmit information on **wind shear conditions** until it is confirmed, either by subsequent aircraft reports or by advice from the associated **MET unit**, that conditions are no longer a hazard to ensure safe operations at the aerodrome.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 381, CAUTION WIND SHEAR. AT 0745 AIRBUS 320 REPORTED AFTER DEPARTURE RUNWAY 30R AT 800 FEET AIRSPEED LOSS OF 20 KNOTS, STRONG RIGHT DRIFT."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, EMIRATES 381."

### 3.3.14 Wake turbulence
When **wake turbulence** is suspected or known to exist, **ATC** will warn aircraft as appropriate.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "A6-CYI, CAUTION WAKE TURBULENCE FROM ARRIVING/DEPARTING (type of aircraft) [additional information as required]."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, A6-CYI."

### 3.3.15 Go around
If the runway is not available for landing, to ensure **ATC separation**, or to avert an unsafe situation, the appropriate instruction will be given. Any transmissions to aircraft should be **brief** and kept to a minimum.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, GO AROUND I SAY AGAIN GO AROUND ACKNOWLEDGE."

    **Pilot**: “GOING AROUND, EMIRATES 642."

Only if time permits, a **reason** for the **go around** instruction should be included.  

In the event that this procedure is initiated by the pilot, the phrase **“GOING AROUND”** will be used. Unless instructed otherwise, an **IFR aircraft** will carry out the **missed approach procedure**, and a **VFR aircraft** will continue in the normal traffic circuit.  

### 3.3.16 After landing
The **pilot** of an aircraft should remain on the **tower frequency** until clear of the runway-in-use. Afterward, the **tower controller** should instruct the aircraft to contact **ground movement control** on the appropriate frequency for taxi instructions.  

The **tower controller** should ensure the arriving aircraft is clear of the **rapid exit taxiway** before handing the aircraft over to **ground movement control**. In this situation, the tower controller may provide an initial taxi instruction to ensure an expeditious flow of traffic and to keep the rapid exit taxiway clear for the next arriving aircraft.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, TAXI RIGHT ON K, HOLD KM."

    **Pilot**: “RIGHT ONTO K, HOLD KM, EMIRATES 642."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, CONTACT GROUND ON 118.350."

    **Pilot**: “CONTACT GROUND 118.350, EMIRATES 642."

If the arriving aircraft is taking too long to vacate, which could impact the safety of the next arriving aircraft, **controllers** shall request that the aircraft **“expedite vacate”**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, EXPEDITE VACATE."

    **Pilot**: “EXPEDITE VACATE, EMIRATES 642."

### 3.3.17 Runway crossings
Sometimes it is necessary to cross aircraft across a runway. The **instruction** should be clear, and instructions for after the crossing should also be included.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 642, AT K11, CROSS RUNWAY 30L, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 30R."

    **Pilot**: “AT K11, CROSS RUNWAY 30L, HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 30R, EMIRATES 642."

## 3.4 Approach and departure control
### 3.4.1 Radar identification
**Vectors** may be given to establish the identification of an aircraft. Other means of **ATS surveillance service identification** include:  

- Use of **position report information**  
- Requesting the aircraft to make **turns**  
- Use of **bearing and distance information** from a prominent object or radio aid  
- **Transfer of control**  
- Use of **SSR**  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 642, FOR IDENTIFICATION TURN LEFT 080."

    **Pilot**: “FOR IDENTIFICATION TURN LEFT 080, OMAN AIR 642."

The **pilot** should be warned if **identification** is lost, or about to be lost, and appropriate **instructions** should be given.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 642, IDENTIFICATION LOST DUE RADAR FAILURE, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.85."

    **Pilot**: “ROGER, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.85, OMAN AIR 642"

    **Controller**: "OMAN AIR 642, WILL SHORTLY LOSE IDENTIFICATION TEMPORARILY, DUE FADE AREA, REMAIN THIS FREQUENCY."

    **Pilot**: “WILCO,  OMAN AIR 642"

### 3.4.2 Radar vectoring
**Radar vectors** can be used to ensure **lateral separation** as well as to position an aircraft for its **final approach course**. Aircraft should be informed of the reason for the vectors unless it is **self-evident**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, TURN LEFT HEADING 050 FOR TRAFFIC."

    **Pilot**: "TURN LEFT HEADING 050, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, TURN RIGHT HEADING 210, BASE LEG."

    **Pilot**: "TURN LEFT HEADING 210, BASE LEG, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, MAINTAIN PRESENT HEADING."

    **Pilot**: "PRESENT HEADING, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, TURN LEFT BY 10 DEGREES, REPORT NEW HEADING."

    **Pilot**: "LEFT BY 10 DEGREES, NEW HEADING 350 DEGREES, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, REPORT YOUR HEADING."

    **Pilot**: "HEADING 050 DEGREES, EMIRATES 4CK."

When **vectoring** is completed, **pilots** will be instructed to **resume their own navigation** and given **position information** and appropriate **instructions** as necessary.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT SENPA."

    **Pilot**: "RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT SENPA, EMIRATES 4CK."

Occasionally, **aircraft** may be instructed to make a complete **turn through 360 degrees** for **delaying purposes** or to achieve the required **spacing** behind preceding traffic.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, ORBIT LEFT FOR SPACING."

    **Pilot**: "ORBIT LEFT FOR SPACING, EMIRATES 4CK."

### 3.4.3 Traffic information and avoiding action
Information regarding **traffic** on a conflicting path should be given in the following form:  

- **Relative bearing** of the conflicting traffic in terms of the 12-hour clock  
- **Distance** from the conflicting traffic  
- **Direction** of the flight of the conflicting traffic  
- Any other **pertinent information** such as:  
  - Unknown  
  - Slow moving  
  - Fast moving  
  - Closing  
  - Opposite (or same) direction  
  - Overtaking  
  - Crossing left to right (or right to left)  
  - If known, **aircraft type** and **level**, **climbing** or **descending**  

**Avoiding action** to be taken by the pilot is given when the controller considers that an **imminent risk of collision** will exist if action is not taken immediately.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 9901, UNKNOWN TRAFFIC 10 O'CLOCK, 11 MILES, FAST MOVING CROSSING RIGHT TO LEFT."

    **Pilot**: "NEGATIVE CONTACT, REQUEST VECTORS, EMIRATES 9901."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 9901, TURN LEFT HEAIDNG 050 DEGREES."

    **Pilot**: "TURN LEFT HEADING 050, EMIRATES 9901."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 9901, CLEAR OF TRAFFIC, RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT TO IVURO."

    **Pilot**: "RESUME OWN NAVIGATION, DIRECT TO IVURO, EMIRATES 9901."

### 3.4.4 Tradar vectors to final approach
**Radar vectors** are given to arriving flights to position them onto a **pilot-interpreted final approach aid**, or to a point from which a **visual approach** can be made. In the following example, an identified aircraft is given radar vectors to the **ILS**.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "DUBAI ARRIVALS, EMIRATES 202, VUTEB3D ARRIVAL, PASSING FL150, DESCENDING TO 10,000 FEET, INFORMATION CHARLIE, QNH 1014."
    
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, DUBAI ARRIVALS, IDENTIFIED, DESCEND TO ALTITUDE 8,000 FEET, EXPECT VECTORING FOR ILS APPROACH RUNWAY 30L, NO DELAY."

    **Pilot**: "DESCEND TO 8,000 FEET, RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, LEAVE PATID HEADING 210."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING PATID HEADING 210, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, REDUCE SPEED TO 210 KNOTS (MINIMUM CLEAN SPEED, NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTIONS, ETC...)."

    **Pilot**: "REDUCE SPEED 210 KNOTS, EMIRATES 202 (OR APPROPRIATE RESPONSE)."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, DESCEND TO ALTITUDE 4,000 FEET, NUMBER FOUR IN TRAFFIC."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING 7,000 FEET DESCENDING TO 4,000 FEET, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, 25 TRACK MILES FROM TOUCH DOWN."

    **Pilot**: "EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, TURN RIGHT HEADING 210 DEGREES, BASE LEG, REDUCE SPEED TO 180 KNOTS."

    **Pilot**: "HEADING 210 DEGREES, REDUCING SPEED TO 180, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, TURN RIGHT HEADING 270 DEGREES, CLEARED FOR ILS APPROACH, RUNWAY 30L, REPORT ESTABLISHED."

    **Pilot**: "HEADING 270 DEGREES, CLEARED ILS RUNWAY 30L, WILCO, EMIRATES 202."

    **Pilot**: "ESTABLISHED ILS RUNWAY 30L, EMIRATES 202."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 202, CONTACT TOWER 119.550."

    **Pilot**: "TOWER 119.550, EMIRATES 202."

The **radar controller** should advise the aircraft of its **position** at least once prior to turning onto the **final approach**.  

**Pilots** will be advised when a controller intends to **vector** an aircraft through the **final approach track** and of the reason for the **track extension**.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QATARI 6H, CONTINUE PRESENT HEADING, TAKING YOU THROUGH THE LOCALIZER FOR SPACING."

    **Pilot**: "CONTINUE PRESENT HEADING, ROGER, QATARI 6H."

### 3.4.5 IFR departures
Most airports handle both **arrivals** and **departures** with a single control unit. At busier airports, **departures** and **arrivals** are handled by specific **departure** and **arrival controllers**.  

In addition to the **ATC route clearance**, further instructions for **separation purposes** may be issued prior to or after take-off.  

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "ABU DHABI RADAR, KLM 426."
    
    **Controller**: "KLM 426, ABU DHABI RADAR, TURN RIGHT HEADING 040 UNTIL PASSING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET, THEN DIRECT KANIP."

    **Pilot**: "TURN RIGHT HEADING 040 UNTIL PASSING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET, THEN DIRECT KANIP, KLM426."

    **Controller**: "KLM 426, REPORT PASSING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET."

    **Pilot**: "REPORT PASING ALTITUDE 7,000 FEET, KLM426"

    **Controller**: "KLM 426, CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.850."

    **Pilot**: "CONTACT U.A.E RADAR 124.850, KLM426."

### 3.4.6 IFR arrivals
**Approach control** should advise, on **initial contact**, the type of approach to be expected (**ILS**, **RNAV**, **Visual**).  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 19D, EXPECT ILS APPROACH RUNWAY 31R AT ABU DHABI."

    **Pilot**: "EXPECT ILS APPROACH RUNWAY 31R, ETIHAD 19D."

On occasion, **IFR aircraft** may not complete the **ILS approach** procedure but instead request permission to make a **visual approach**. When the specific requirements for a visual approach have been met, the pilot may make the request using the phrase **“REQUEST VISUAL APPROACH”**. **Controllers** will grant the request when traffic permits.  

When cleared by **ATC** for a visual approach, further descent is **unrestricted**, except when a specific restriction is included with the clearance for a visual approach or in a subsequent clearance.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "ETIHAD 19D, CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH, RUNWAY 31R."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED VISUAL APPROACH, RUNWAY 31R, ETIHAD 19D."

### 3.4.7 Clearance via the SID

  - **CLEARED DIRECT <waypoint>, DESCEND TO <Cleared level>**  
  - Then: **REJOIN STAR <STAR designator> AT <waypoint>**

## 3.5 Area Control
Much of the phraseology used in **area control** is of a general nature and similar to that of **approach** and **departure**. However, many instructions used in area control (particularly where **radar** is not available) are related to specific conditions in order to maintain aircraft separation.

### 3.5.1 Descent clearance
To assist with establishing altitude restrictions, pilots may be assigned the following:

- `AT OR ABOVE`: The aircraft must maintain the specified altitude or a higher altitude.
- `AT OR BELOW`: The aircraft must maintain the specified altitude or a lower altitude.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "AIR INDIA 397, REQUEST DESCENT."
    
    **Controller**: "AIR INDIA 398, MAINTAIN FL360, EXPECT DESCENT AFTER PASOV."

    **Pilot**: "MAINTAIN FL350, AIR INDIA 397."

    **Controller**: "AIR INDIA 397, DESCEND TO FL150, CROSS PASOV FL180 OR ABOVE."

    **Pilot**: "DESCEND TO FL150, CROSS PASOV FL170 OR ABOVE, AIR INDIA 397."

### 3.5.2 Position Information
To help establish and maintain separation, pilots may be instructed to provide the following:

- **Additional Position Reports**: Pilots may be required to report their position, altitude, or any other relevant details.
- **Routing Reports**: Pilots may be asked to report specific waypoints, heading changes, or other navigational information.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, REPORT 25 MILES FROM THE DOHA VOR."

    **Pilot**: "WILCO, SAUDIA 550."

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, REPORT DISTANCE FROM THE DOHA VOR."

    **Pilot**: "DISTANCE 37 MILES FROM THE DOHA VOR, SAUDIA 550."

### 3.5.3 Level information
Level information includes climb and descent clearances, as well as instructions and reports of leaving, reaching, and passing levels, as outlined in the Level Instructions section of the general procedures and phraseology.

- **Vacating Levels**: Unless instructed otherwise, the aircraft is expected to vacate the level as soon as practicable.
- **Immediate Descent**: In exceptional circumstances, where an instant descent is required, the word "immediately" will be used.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, WHEN READY DESCEND TO FL150."

    **Pilot**: "WHEN READY DESCEND TO FL150, SAUDIA 550."

    **Controller**: "SAUDIA 550, DESCEND TO FL200, IMMEDIATELY DUE TRAFFIC."

    **Pilot**: "DESCENDING FL200, SAUDIA 550."

An aircraft may request a clearance to climb or descend while maintaining its own separation in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). This clearance is available only in Class D airspace.

- The clearance will include essential traffic information to ensure situational awareness.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "EGYPTAIR 345, REQUEST MAINTAIN OWN SEPARATION IN VMC, DESCENT TO 6,000 FEET."

    **Controller**: "EGYPTAIR 345, DESCEND TO ALTITUDE 6,000 FEET, MAINTAIN OWN SEPARATION IN VMC FROM 9,000 FEET TO 7,000 FEET... TRAFFIC IS..."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING ... FOR ALTITUDE 6,000 FEET, MAINTAIN OWN SEPARATION IN VMC 9,000 FEET TO 7,000 FEET, TRAFFIC AT <ALTITUDE>, EGYPTAIR 345."

### 3.5.4 Flights entering controlled airspace
IFR or VFR aircraft wishing to enter controlled airspace must make their request to the appropriate ATS unit in sufficient time. This allows ATC to assess the traffic situation and issue a clearance before the aircraft reaches the boundary of controlled airspace.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "U.A.E RADAR, PQR."

    **Controller**: "PQR, U.A.E RADAR, PASS YOUR MESSAGE."

    **Pilot**: "PQR, ESTIMATING DARAX 45, ALTITUDE 9,000 FEET, REQUEST CLEARANCE."

    **Controller**: "PQR, CLEARED TO ABU DHABI, VIA M318, ALTITUDE 9,000 FEET, ENTER CONTROL AREA AT DARAX, SQUAWK 5472, QNH 1014."

    **Pilot**: "CLEARED TO ABU DHABI, VIA M318, ALTITUDE 9,000 FEET, ENTER CONTROL AREA AT DARAX, SQUAWK 5472, QNH 1014, PQR."

    **Controller**: "PQR, READBACK CORRECT."

Due to prevailing traffic conditions, a clearance may not be issued immediately. **In such cases, a transponder (squawk) code may be provided to assist ATC in assessing the traffic situation. This code does not constitute a clearance to enter controlled airspace.**

!!! example
    **Controller**: "PQR, REMAIN OUTSIDE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE, EXPECT CLEARANCE AT TIME 55."

    **Pilot**: "REMAINING OUTSIDE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE, PQR."

### 3.5.5 Flights leaving controlled airspace
Flights leaving controlled airspace will normally be provided with a track or specific point by which to depart, **along with any other relevant instructions required to ensure safe separation.**

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "A6-CTL, NIBAX 17, 6,000 FEET, ESTIMATE ZAKUM FIELD AT 1253."

    **Controller**: "A6-CTL, LEAVE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE ON TRACK ZAKUM, AT ALTITUDE 6,000 FEET IFR, TRAFFIC IS ... RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE ON TRACK ZAKUM, AT 6,000 FEET, COPY THE TRAFFIC, A6-CTL."

    **Controller**: "A6-CTL, LEAVE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE IN DESCENT, REPORT PASSING ALTITUDE 4,500 FEET, QNH 1014, NO REPORTED TRAFFIC, RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED."

    **Pilot**: "LEAVING CONTROLLED AIRSPACE IN DESCENT, WILL REPORT ALTITUDE 4,500 FEET, QNH 1014, NO REPORTED TRAFFIC, A6-CTL."

### 3.5.6 Holding en-route
When an aircraft is required to hold en-route, the controller should issue holding instructions and a time at which onward clearance can be expected. **Where it is not self-evident, the reason for the delay should also be given.** Within the Arabian FIRs, **a time for an onward clearance is only given if the delay is in excess of 20 minutes.**

!!! example
    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, HOLD AT IMPED, FL220, EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE, AT TIME 02, LANDING DELAYS AT DUBAI 20 MINUTES."

    **Pilot**: "HOLD AT IMPED, FL220, EMIRATES 4CK."

    **Controller**: "EMIRATES 4CK, HOLD AT VUTEB, FL160."

    **Pilot**: "HOLD AT VUTEB, FL160, EMIRATES 4CK."
