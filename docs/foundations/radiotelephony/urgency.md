# 4. Distress & Urgency Messages
## 4.1 General mayday procedures
From time to time, aircraft may request to simulate emergencies. As a controller, you have the discretion to approve or deny these requests based on traffic levels, workload, and your experience.  

- **Distress Messages**: The word *“MAYDAY”* spoken at the beginning of a transmission identifies a distress situation.  
- **Urgency Messages**: The word *“PAN PAN”* spoken at the start of a transmission identifies an urgency situation.  

Ideally, *“MAYDAY”* or *“PAN PAN”* should be spoken **three times** at the start of the initial distress or urgency call.  

### 4.1.1 Transmission Priorities  
1. **Distress messages** take priority over all other transmissions.  
2. **Urgency messages** take priority over all transmissions except distress messages.  

Controllers should adjust phraseology and procedures as necessary, considering their specific operational needs and the time available.  

### 4.1.2 Elements of a Distress Message  
A distress message should include as many of the following elements as possible, ideally in the order shown:  

1. **Aircraft identification**  
2. **Nature of the emergency**  
3. **Pilot’s intentions**  
4. **Position, heading, and altitude**  
5. **Any other pertinent information**
