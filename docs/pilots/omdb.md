Dubai International Airport is the primary gateway for Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. It ranks as the world's busiest airport by international passenger traffic and is also the largest airport in the Middle East. Globally, it is the second busiest by total passenger volume and the leading airport for Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 operations.

Located 2.54 nautical miles east of Dubai's city center in the Al Garhoud district, the airport is home to Emirates Airline and low-cost carrier FlyDubai.

!!! Tip
    Dubai International is one of the busiest globally and the most active in the Middle East. Due to the high volume of traffic during peak hours and the airport's operational complexity, **it is essential that you prepare thoroughly**, as any professional crew would. Be sure to review this brief and the corresponding charts carefully.

    **If you are new to the VATSIM Network**, we strongly recommend avoiding this airport until you have gained more experience flying on the network. During peak times, controllers are often too busy to offer additional assistance. Instead, consider flying to other airports within the Arabian vACC, where the traffic is lighter and procedures are less complex, allowing for a more accommodating experience.

### Charts & Scenery

!!! Warning
    The latest airport layout is reflected in MSFS, X-Plane, and the freeware Prepar3D sceneries. However, the payware Prepar3D scenery from FlyTampa features the 2012 airport layout, which lacks Concourse D and some taxiways/rapid-exits. Pilots using the FlyTampa scenery must inform the controller of this on initial contact.

!!! Warning
    It's crucial that you pay close attention to the frequency you're being transferred to. Do not attempt to guess the next frequency, and never switch frequencies without explicit instructions from the controller. Auto-handoffs are not used at Dubai International. If you're unsure, don’t hesitate to ask for the frequency again!

## Departing Traffic
### Flight Planning: Route(s)
Pilots can find valid routes for most flights departing from Dubai on SimBrief by choosing the "Preferred Route" option. Our operations department updates the "Preferred Route" on SimBrief with every AIRAC cycle, ensuring compliance with Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations in the Middle East and Eurocontrol IFPS validation.

### Flight Planning: Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
Controllers will assign a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) based on the first waypoint in your flight plan, guiding you out of the Dubai Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA). Refer to the table below to see which SID you can expect. If your waypoint isn't listed in the table, ensure your AIRAC cycle is up to date. If your AIRAC is outdated, please inform the controller promptly so we can arrange an omnidirectional departure for you. All initial climbs are set at 4000ft!

| Waypoint |  12L/R  |  30L/R  |
|----------|:-------:|:-------:|
| ANVIX    |   5G    |   7F    |
| DAVMO    |   4G    |   4F    |
| EMERU    |   2G    |   2F    |
| IVURO    |   1G    |   1F    |
| KUTLI    |   4G    |   4F    |
| MIROT    |   3G    |   3F    |
| NABIX    |   3G    |   3F    |
| RIDAP    |   3G    |   2F    |
| SENPA    |   3G    |   2F    |

!!! Note
    Please be aware that the departures listed above apply to both the left and right runways. At Dubai International, there are no runway-specific SIDs, so your clearance will not include a designated runway. You can determine your departure runway by checking the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).

### Getting your clearance
Departing aircraft shall contact Dubai Delivery **10 minutes prior to start-up** and pass the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Aircraft Callsign</li>
    <li>Aircraft Type</li>
    <li>Parking Stand</li>
    <li>Requested Flight Level</li>
    <li>Destination</li>
    <li>Standard Instrument Departure (and departure speed if unable to comply with SID minimum speed restrictions)</li>
    <li>Current Departure ATIS Information</li>
    <li>Aircraft routing via M318 to report crossing level for GABKO if below FL150</li>
</ul>

#### Datalink Clearance (DCL)
The preferred method for obtaining your clearance is through datalink. To request clearance via Hoppie datalink, send your request to **OMDB**. Please note that logging on to the station is not required. No readback is necessary.

#### Voice Clearance
In Dubai, if datalink clearances are unavailable, voice clearances will be provided. These will be brief, covering only your Standard Instrument Departure (SID), initial climb, and squawk code. Ensure you have the latest departure ATIS information before proceeding.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Dubai Delivery, good evening, UAE1GP, Boeing 777-300ER, stand A8, requesting FL360, to Nice, NABIX3F departure, with information F on board."

    **Controller**: "UAE1GP, information F correct, cleared to Nice via the NABIX3F departure, maintain altitude 4000ft, squawk 0542."

    **Pilot**: "UAE1GP, readback is correct, QNH 1004, report ready for push and start"

!!! warning
    Clearance delivery will not provide push and start clearance. However, remain on the clearance delivery frequency; do not switch to the ground frequency on your own. You must report fully ready on the delivery frequency—this includes having the jetway disconnected, tug connected, and chocks removed. Delivery will advise when to switch to the appropriate ground frequency, based on the current airport departure rate.

#### Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM)
Dubai has implemented **A**irport **C**ollaborative **D**ecision **M**aking (**A-CDM**) procedures to ensure efficient operations and reduce time spent at the holding point. Pilots are required to adhere to assigned A-CDM times. When A-CDM procedures are in effect, this will be announced in the ATIS. Pilots should set their **T**arget **O**ff **B**lock **T**ime (**TOBT**) and update it whenever their estimate changes by more than 5 minutes using the [VATMENA vACDM Pilot Interface](https://vacdm.vatsim.me), aiding controllers in departure planning.

If you are unfamiliar with A-CDM procedures, please refer to our A-CDM pilot guide (coming soon™).

### Push & Start
Once clearance delivery releases you to the designated ground frequency, pilots may request push and start clearance. Upon initial contact, the ground controller may provide various types of pushback instructions. Pilots must ensure they can comply with these instructions; if unable, they must inform the ground controller.

Pushback clearances will specify a direction to face, such as West or East, and a particular taxiway to push onto.

!!! info
    The IniBuilds Dubai GSX profile (available through IniManager) includes most of the pushback clearances you can expect. If you don't have this profile installed, ensure you can follow the pushback instructions using the GSX Quick Edit option.

!!! example
    **Controller**: "UAE4CK, push and start is approved face west onto taxiway Z."

!!! warning
    If pilots are unable to commence pushback within 2-3 minutes, the pushback clearance may be revoked, and slot times will be recalculated.

#### Pushback Types

### Taxi
#### Standard Intersection Departures
For the purposes of takeoff performance planning the standard departure taxiways are:

* 12R - K3/K4/K5
* 12L - M1C/N1C
* 30R - M13A/M14A
* 30L - K15A/M18A

Crews should base their performance calculations on departure from standard departure points from the notified runway in use if there is no restriction to payload.

ATC may tactically use a different departure point nearer the runway end based on the traffic situation.

### Take-off

#### Minimum Runway Occupancy
On receipt of a line-up clearance pilots shall ensure, complying with safety and standard operating procedures, that they are able to line-up on the runway as soon as the preceding aircraft has commenced take-off roll.

Wherever possible, pilots are encouraged to conduct a rolling takeoff to minimise runway occupancy time.

#### Reduced Runway Separation Minima (RRSM)
